# Buffer-Overflow-Demo

## Overview:
- Read through the Buffer Overflow Demo pdf in this directory to orient yourself to these files and what they each do.
- These techniques start with a vulnerable program with a simple buffer overflow vulnerability du to the use of strcpy when reading a file into a buffer.
- We then introduce various system protections, such as address randomization, StackGuard, and Non-executable stacks, and how to get some of them.
- How to create a NOP sled.
- Use GDB to locate addresses we need.
- Follow-on to this demo will be in my Return-to-libc demo.
